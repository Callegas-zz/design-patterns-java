## Singleton

Ensures that your class is instantiated once, initialization already guarantees the instance, Global access can not be variable, it has to be done only this way, it can be used in a file manager, or a connector of a database. data for example ...

Gain performace and brings a quality and semantics to the code.

> Problems:
The class can be instantiated only once
It's not Single Responsibility, but in this case I do not see it as a real problem.
Generates coupling
