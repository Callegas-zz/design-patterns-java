## Prototype

With it we create a generic prototype and work with clones from it. It is well based on inheritance and it is recommended to use when these classes will also have a shorter period. Another nice example is the question of a class that has different states and this can be much more advantageous than creating / instantiating again.

We can append at runtime, Reduce subclasses, Dynamic

> problems:
The subclasses are going to have a clone, referencing can be complexity.
