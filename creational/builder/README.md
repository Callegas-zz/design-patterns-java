## Builder
Builder already works with a broader concept, as a packaging operator you can build things by layer, you can use set to slowly build your object. This process can create the same object in different ways as it is being shaped.

Rather used to create complex objects and make this creation seem simpler and semantic, it breaks the process into pieces making it more manageable. This construction becomes dynamic and can also be reused

> problems:
Need to build more than one builder as needed for more instances
