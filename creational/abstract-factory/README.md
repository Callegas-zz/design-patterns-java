## Abstract Factory
It works like a simple Wrapper, where the idea is to isolate the use of creation. has the need to create a WHOLE built object, with all the parameters passed directly. The decision is for the subclass.
In a possible creation we can make the manufacture according to this subclass without having to put conditionals and create and thus bring a snowball to our code.

It is a well-used, practical and easy-to-implement standard where other developers will not have difficulty locating, avoid coupling in code and encapsulate what is interesting to be encapsulated.

> Problems:
The code can start to get very long and with many conditionals, there are other patterns that applied together could solve this question, but thinking only of it would be a problem.
